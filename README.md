Discord channel backup bot.  

A discord channel backup bot. Created with python, used for backing up all text messages, images and files of a discord channel into a neat HTML/CSS formatted page.  
This version is stripped down to its bare functionality in order to not have the bot republished.

Usage instructions:  
1 - Download the bot python file  
2 - Enter your server's ID and your token  
3 - Run the /archivechannel command  
4 - Wait 5-10 seconds (depends on the channel size)  
5 - The bot will backup the entire channel to an HTML page - including all files, images and messages  
6 - The bot will proceed to send the HTML page as a file in a message  
  
The HTML page will look like this:
